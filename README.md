## 📖 Project Overview

**Latin Dragon** wasn't just born from a coursework assignment—it was inspired by a real need from a real friend.

### 🎯 The Story Behind the Project

When I started my Web Development course, I wanted to create something meaningful beyond just fulfilling academic requirements. That's when my Latin American friend, an ambitious young entrepreneur running a China-Latin America import/export startup, shared his struggles with me. Despite having valuable trade expertise and connections, he was finding it incredibly difficult to establish a professional online presence and reach potential clients.

**The Challenge:** Like many small business owners in the trade industry, he lacked accessible marketing channels and professional content to showcase his expertise. The China-LAC trade market, while growing rapidly (26-fold in the past 20 years!), suffers from a lack of centralized, quality information resources.

**The Solution:** **Latin Dragon** - a comprehensive trade information platform that not only serves as a digital bridge for entrepreneurs and small businesses but also helps them build professional credibility through content marketing.

This project demonstrates how web development can solve real business problems. Built as part of my first-year Web Development coursework at University of London, it showcases practical application of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript while addressing genuine market needs in the China-Latin America trade sector.
